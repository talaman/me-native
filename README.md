# me-native

Welcome to the `me-native` repository! This project is a personal endeavor to create a dynamic and interactive resume using React Native. It showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a A4 format.

The app is built using React Native and utilizes JSON data to populate the resume with my skills, experiences, and projects. The app is designed to be easily customizable, allowing users to update and customize content to reflect their current skills and experiences.

You can check the production version of the app at [me-native.talaman.info](https://me-native.talaman.info/) that was deployed using GitHub Actions.

The CI/CD pipeline for this project is automated using GitHub Actions, the Production version has protection rules to ensure that the code is reviewed before merging to the main branch.
