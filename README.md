# me-native

Welcome to the `me-native` repository! This project is a personal endeavor to create a dynamic and interactive resume using React Native. It showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a A4 format.

You can check the production version of the app at [me-native.talaman.info](https://me-native.talaman.info/) that was deployed using GitHub Actions.
